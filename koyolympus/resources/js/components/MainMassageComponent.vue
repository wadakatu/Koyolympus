            <p>No one is immortal. No one can put back the clock. Nothing stays the same.
                That's why people cannot stop taking photography because
                photography is a means of capturing and preserving the instant that doesn't come twice.
                Therefore, we explore the world with our camera and chase whatever we love and feel great
                to cut out the exact moment that we would like to keep as it is.
